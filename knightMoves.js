   * "For this project,

   * 
   * "Treat all possible moves the knight could
   *  make as children in a tree"
   * ---from odin project
   * 
   * if each possible move is a child in a tree then
   * what should the root be?
   * should the starting move be the root and all
   * possible moves be the children nodes?
   * or should each possible move be a tree
   * of it's own just a path to the end.
   * 
   * 
   * figure out a data structure suitable for storing
   * possible moves such that they are children in a tree
   * 
   * Treat all possible moves the knight
   * could make as children in a tree.
   * 
   * //edge list
   * possibleMoves is an array of arrays
   * it is also an array of edges 
   * which is called an edge list
   * to search it will use linear search to find a particular
   * edge or coord in this context
   *
   *  
   * project ask for possible moves to be store in a data
   * structure similar to a tree.
   * Q:would an edge list be a suitable data structure?
   * A:I'm not sure maybe?
   * It's what I have now so it works in that sense...
   * Q:does it sore possible moves or edges suchs that
   * they are children in a tree?
   * A:I don't think it does. does it?
   * 
   * //adjacency list
   * For each vertext i store an array of vertices adjacent to it.
   * an array of |V| adjacency lists one per vertex
   * 
   * it's an array of arrays like an edge list expect it stores
   * list of adjacent verticies instead of a list of edges
   * 
   * I don't think adjaceny list would be a good fit
   * edge list seems like a better fit from what I know right
   * now.
   * 
   * right now each possible move is an array with two elements
   * representing an x and y coordinate 
   * that two element array gets stored into an array
   * this array that holds the coordiantes is 
   * the possible moves list
   * each element could be a root 
   * each element is the start of a path towards the
   * desired end coordiante
   * 
   * to change [x,y] into a tree like structure
   * I could add a third and fourth element l and r
   * this could be the tree struct [[x,y],l,r]
   * first element is the coordinate [x,y]
   * second element is the left child node
   * third element is the right child node
   * 
   * if a node has no children then 
   * the third element the left child node
   * will just hold the value null
   * same is true for the right child node.
   * 
   * example of leaf node
   * [[x,y],l=null,r=null]
   * 
   * example of a non leaf node:
   * [[x,y],[[x,y],l,r],[[x,y],l,r]];
   * 
   * I don't think left or right has significant meaning
   * like in a binary tree in this context
   * So instead of left and right child nodes
   * there are just nodes
   * 
   * redo: 
   * a node is a 2 element array -> [1,2]
   * first element is a coordiante and a possible move
   * --> [[x,y], ?]
   * second element is a child node if present else
   * it's node in the case of a leaf node 
   * [[x,y],childNode=null] or [[x,y],[[x,y],childNode=null]]
   * 
   * redo the redo:
   * after thinking about finding end move in possible moves
   * and how that leads to finding the shortest move
   * 
   * I realized that child node or a node in general is
   * not [[x,y],childNode] with Child Node just being
   * another coordiante with it's own child node or not
   * child node is a list of all possible moves that can
   * be made from it's parent node
   * the possible moves list its self is a node 
   * example:
   *  [[[x,y],listOfPossibleMoveFromParent]]
   * which might look like this:
   * 
   * //list of possible moves from start
   * [
   *  // child node 1: an array with two elements
   *     first element is the first possible move from start
   *     second element is a list of possible moves from
   *     the first possible move from start.
   *  [
   *    //first possible move
   *    [x,y],
   *     //list of possible moves from first possible move
   *     [
   *      //first possible move from first possible move
   *      [[x,y],],
   *      //second possible move from second possible move
   *      [[x,y],],
   *      //third possible move from first possible move
   *      [[x,y],],
   *    ]
   *  ],
   * 
   *  // same as child node 1 expect it's for child node 2
   *  [
   *    //second possible move
   *    [x,y],

   * ]
   * 
   * should start move be in list of possible moves
   * instead of

     does it have a trade off?

     it uses array so it uses temporary space
